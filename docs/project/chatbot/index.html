<p>It's now running on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beingbarbarianistough/">Facebook Fan Page</a> Send it a message and get started!</p>

<p>In this project, we are using <strong>Dexter</strong>, which is a platform people can create automated conversation. I will talk about data preparation, discussion, and challenge.<br />
The goal is to create a facebook fan page Chatbot in both Mandarin Chinese and English that help to manage fan page private message for Taiwanese Student Association (TSA).<br />
It should respond to messages related to:</p>

<ol>
<li>sponsorship/ public relation /marketing cooperation<br /></li>
<li>New Student Orientation Event Info<br /></li>
<li>frequent asked questions from new incoming students<br />
<br /></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-data-preparation">1. Data Preparation</h3>

<p>Before I started writing the content of TSA bot, I thought it might be helpful to dig into the messages we received in the past. Therefore, I decided to download the facebook page message history. This can be done using Facebook Developers Graph API. And then we can use a GitHub python package <a href="https://github.com/eisenjulian/fb-page-chat-download">&quot;FB-page-chat-download&quot;</a> to extract the data. Its output is a CSV file.</p>

<p>It follows three steps: data pre-processing, tokenization, and analysis</p>

<ul>
<li>data pre-preprocessing divides the chat into 4 categories: user questions in Chinese, TSA response in Chinese, users questions in English, and TSA responses in English.<br /></li>
<li>Tokenization splits the sentences into words and saves nouns into a dictionary.<br /></li>
<li>Analyzation return questions and answering contain the 100 most frequent words.<br />
<br /></li>
</ul>

<p>To make the process more interesting, I draw a word cloud based on the most frequent word from the chat.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from PIL import Image
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from wordcloud import WordCloud, ImageColorGenerator

def graph(freq):
    font = &quot;/System/Library/Fonts/STHeiti Medium.ttc&quot;
    wordcloud = WordCloud(font_path=font,width=2400, height=2400, margin=2).generate_from_frequencies(frequencies=freq)
    plt.figure(figsize=(20,10),dpi=300)
    plt.imshow(wordcloud, interpolation='bilinear')
    plt.axis(&quot;off&quot;)
    plt.show()
</code></pre>

<h3 id="2-discussion-challenge">2. Discussion &amp; Challenge</h3>

<p>Dexter makes rule-based Chatbot easier to implement by using Regular Expression.</p>

<pre><code>+ Users Question
- Chatbot Response
</code></pre>

<p>We can deploy it on Facebook, Slack, Website Embedded, Twitter and etc. They have several functions such as insert buttons, links, media, HTTP get,  HTTP post and etc.<br />
One interesting basic function I want to talk about is <strong>&quot;topics&quot;</strong>. Topics allow us to organize the dialogue into subsections. In my case, I have mainly three topics &quot;Information Sharing&quot;, &quot;Upcoming Events&quot;, and &quot;New Students Questions&quot;<br />
The default page is used as a menu page and people should go to the corresponding channel. The issue is, people don't like this idea. They rather spit out the question and stuck in the &quot;out of vocab&quot; loop. I started to think it's not a good idea to have topics.<br />
One good thing about topics is that it is domain specific with the restricted environment and can do follow up answering. Some keywords might also be used in other topics.</p>

<pre><code>+ (english|è‹±æ–‡)
- What brings you here today? &lt;send&gt; I am not able to chat. I can &quot;ONLY&quot; take care of mainly three topics. Information Sharing for students, school administration, sponsors who are looking for promotion. TSA might help you advertise your event, research, job information. &lt;send&gt; Upcoming Events will tell you the information about our most recent event. &lt;send&gt; New Student Questions are frequent questions asked by the new incoming student. &lt;send&gt; You can also reply &quot;help&quot; to learn how to communicate with me =( ^buttons(&quot;Information Sharing&quot;, &quot;Upcoming Events&quot;, &quot;New Student Questions&quot;) If you want to see the buttons again, reply &quot;menu&quot;.

+ information sharing
- What would you like to share with us?{topic=sharing}

+ upcoming events
- TSA New Student Orientation @ Taiwan is coming soon. \n Time and location\n is 5/25(Sat) at GIS NTU Convention Center from 9am-12pm. Feel free to ask me any question about it!{topic=coming-events}

+ new student questions
- Go ahead! I am listening =) I can help to answer questions about housing, dorm, transportation, environment, bank, entertainment, and other general information.{topic=faq}

</code></pre>

<p>I have some users who asked questions about transportation at &quot;Information-Sharing&quot; channel. And ended up getting &quot;out of vocabulary again&quot;. The answer is the in new student question, but they just don't go there.<br />
Therefore, I gave clear instruction on the purpose of each channel. There was one user who didn't even read and started asking questions.<br />
Thus, I am thinking about removing the topics now...</p>

<p>Another function we can use is to <strong>capture the last message with a percentage sign</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>+ ([*]open[*]bank[*]|[*]bank[*])
- There are mainly 3 banks in Urbana Champaign. Busey Bank, PNC Bank, and Chase bank. &lt;send&gt; PNC is a partner of U of I. (And also a partner of TSA). Check their info here ^link(&quot;https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking/banking/student-banking/university-of-illinois.html&quot;) &lt;send&gt; We also recommend Chase, because it's a national bank. &lt;send&gt; Are you familiar with the types of Bank Account? (reply &quot;yep&quot; or &quot;nah&quot;)

+ yep
- Do you need TSA taking you to the PNC bank

+ yes
% do you need tsa taking you to the pnc bank 
- We will post a sign-up link in late July or early August. Follow our facebook page~! 

+ no
% do you need tsa taking you to the pnc bank 
- When you go to open your account, take your passport and immigration documents(i-20) with you to serve as identification. ðŸ˜Š

#% are you familiar with the types of bank account
+ nah
- There are two basic types of bank accounts: checking accounts and savings accounts. &lt;send&gt; With a checking account you can deposit your money in the account and access those funds with a debit card

</code></pre>

<p>The reason I wrote &quot;reply yep or nah&quot; is that I did't want to conflict it with the following question &quot;do you need tsa taking you to the pnc bank&quot;<br />
 % did not capture &quot;Are you familiar with the types of Bank Account?&quot; Is it because the message is a long paragraph?<br />
 It also did not work if the questions contain buttons.<br />
 It's a very confusing function that I actually want to use more in the future.</p>

<p>p.s. The free version of Dexter bot is limited to 10 ppl person. I asked a couple of new students and friends to help me test it. And it exceeds the limits. Now I am paying ðŸ˜‚.<br />
 <strong>Users are impatient</strong>, they asked only 1-2 questions. If they didn't receive the answer they like, they left.<br />
 <strong>Users are unreasonable</strong>, (or I am unreasonable). Apparently, it's a bot for new students question and answering, why they asked questions like &quot;When should we have dinner&quot;, &quot;what should I eat for dinner&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Do I think data preparation is helpful?</strong><br />
To be honest, I think people attitude and their wording is really different when they talk to a chatbot; less complete sentence, less polite. I knew about it. But its a different case to see the truth.<br />
It is still helpful in case of finding keywords.</p>

<h3 id="final-thought">Final Thought:</h3>

<p><strong>To write a chatbot is easy, but to make users like it is difficult.</strong></p>
