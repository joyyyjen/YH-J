# Hi! I am Joy

I am a senior at UIUC majoring in Linguistics, with a minor in Computer Science. My interest and concentration is natural language processing (NLP). I am currently applying for both graduate school and am looking for jobs related to text processing, information retrieval, or linguistic analysis.

In addition, I am one of the co-presidents in the Taiwanese Student Association at UIUC. I am supervising public relation, marketing, technology, corporate, and graduate departments.

Here are a few things I'm experienced with:

    Python      C++
    Java        Git
    Linux       Mac

May 2017 - August 2017 | Taipei, Taiwan

- Tagged syntactic and semantic features based on Role and Reference Grammar on English and Chinese sentences  
- Cooperated with a software developer to build a syntactically tagged corpus aiming at AI training and testing on language learning at different levels 

## <span class = icon2-terminal></span>  Selected Project

Present

- Built a Flask front end to corporate with recognition application for speech recognition and text analyzation by getting recognition files from user and posting classification result
- Classified errors on speech-driven recognition text in categories of merge, split, inflection, stem and lemmatization 

**<a href="/project/topic-detection" style="color:#FC7E0F;">Topic Detection</a>** | genism
December 2018

- Built topic model on RateMD database by applying latent Dirichlet allocation model from Gensim library.

May 2018

- Performed a series of sentiment classification comparison on Random Forest, SVM, and Naïve Bayes classifiers with advanced features stemming, part of speech tagging, n-gram, and feature extractions
- Improved performance to 85% accuracy using ranker, n-gram, information gain on Naïve Bayes multinomial

**<a href="/project/language-identification" style="color:#FC7E0F;">Text Classification: Language Identification</a>** |  NLTK
March 2018

- Implemented statistical letter and word-based n-gram models with smoothing for English, Italian, and Spanish.
- Achieved above 95% for both letter and word-based language models for test sets between 300 to 2000 sentences.

**<a href="/project/spell-checker" style="color:#FC7E0F;">Spell Checker</a>** | phonetics 
November 2017

- Normalized the text by tokenizing the consonant clusters using the greedy algorithm and nltk library
- Utilized phonetics, phonology, and spelling rules of Yupik language to enforce spell checks
